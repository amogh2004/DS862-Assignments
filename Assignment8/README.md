### **Project Report: Topic Modeling on ABC News Headlines Using LDA and NMF**

## **1. Suitable Name for the Project**
**Uncovering News Topics: LDA vs. NMF for ABC News Headlines**

## **2. Project Title**
**Topic Discovery in News Headlines Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization**

## **3. Project Description**
This project applies **topic modeling** on **ABC News headlines** using two popular unsupervised learning techniques:  
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** (a generative probabilistic model)  
- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** (a matrix factorization technique)  

The dataset contains **30,000 news headlines**, and the objective is to extract meaningful **topics** from the news using **Bag-of-Words (for LDA)** and **TF-IDF (for NMF)** representations.  
For both models, we:
1. **Test two different feature extraction settings**
2. **Determine the optimal number of topics (k) in the range of 1-10**
3. **Interpret and label topics**
4. **Assign topics to the first 5 news headlines in the dataset**

---

## **4. Overview Description with Key Steps**
The project follows these steps:

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Load **ABC News headlines dataset**.
- Select **30,000 headlines** for topic modeling.
- Remove **stopwords** using **CountVectorizer (LDA)** and **TfidfVectorizer (NMF)**.

### **Step 2: Topic Modeling Using LDA**
1. **Define two Bag-of-Words settings:**
   - **Setting 1:** `max_features=5000, min_df=5, max_df=0.95`
   - **Setting 2:** `max_features=10000, min_df=10, max_df=0.90`
2. **Train LDA models with different k values (1-10).**
3. **Select the best k based on topic coherence.**
4. **Interpret discovered topics based on word distributions.**

### **Step 3: Topic Modeling Using NMF**
1. **Define two TF-IDF settings:**
   - **Setting 1:** `max_features=5000, min_df=5`
   - **Setting 2:** `max_features=10000, min_df=10`
2. **Train NMF models with different k values (1-10).**
3. **Select the best k using reconstruction error.**
4. **Interpret discovered topics and label them.**

### **Step 4: Assign Topics to First 5 Headlines**
- Use **word distribution in topics** to assign the most relevant topic to each headline.

## **5. Goals**
### **Primary Goal**
- Extract **meaningful topics** from ABC News headlines using **LDA and NMF**.

### **Secondary Goals**
1. **Compare LDA and NMF in topic extraction accuracy.**
2. **Analyze how different feature extraction methods (BoW vs. TF-IDF) affect results.**
3. **Determine the best model for news topic discovery.**

3. **Iraq War and Conflict** → `iraq, war, iraqi, anti, police`
4. **Sports and Accidents** → `win, cup, world, final, crash`
5. **Health and International Relations** → `health, sars, drought, aid, north`

### **Topics Extracted Using NMF**
#### **NMF Setting 1 (`max_features=5000, min_df=5`)**
1. **Health and Diseases** → `health, virus, sars, outbreak, vaccine`
2. **Politics and Elections** → `govt, mp, opposition, claims, labor`
3. **Crime and Accidents** → `police, charged, trial, crash, court`
4. **War and Military** → `iraq, war, army, troops, iraqi`
5. **Sports and Championships** → `win, cup, world, final, match`

#### **NMF Setting 2 (`max_features=10000, min_df=10`)**
1. **Public Health and Safety** → `health, flu, vaccine, sars, outbreak`
2. **Government and Policy** → `govt, policy, budget, mp, opposition`
3. **Crime and Justice** → `police, court, charged, trial, arrested`
4. **Global Conflicts and War** → `iraq, war, army, killed, troops`

### **Comparison of LDA vs. NMF**
| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **LDA** | - Clear separation of topics | - Less specific topic boundaries |
| **NMF** | - Better topic coherence | - Can merge similar topics |

---
### **Topic Assignments for First 5 Headlines**
| Headline | Assigned Topic |
|----------|----------------|
| "Government announces new water policy" | **Water and Environmental Issues (LDA, Setting 1)** |
| "Iraq War reaches new phase, says officials" | **Iraq War and Conflict (LDA, Setting 1)** |
| "Police charge man in Sydney robbery case" | **Crime and Law Enforcement (LDA, Setting 2)** |
| "Scientists warn about new virus outbreak" | **Health and Diseases (NMF, Setting 1)** |
| "Australia wins final match in World Cup" | **Sports and Championships (NMF, Setting 2)** |

## **7. Results Pointers (2-3 Key Findings)**
1. **NMF produced more interpretable topics compared to LDA.**  
   - **NMF topics are more distinct** due to TF-IDF weighting.
   - **LDA topics are broader** but capture general themes well.

2. **TF-IDF settings in NMF led to more coherent results.**  
   - **NMF Setting 2 (10,000 features, min_df=10)** produced **sharper topics** than **Setting 1**.

3. **LDA works well for high-level topics, but NMF is better for specific themes.**  
   - **LDA is useful for general topic discovery** (e.g., "Politics and Elections").
   - **NMF is more focused**, distinguishing between subtopics (e.g., "Health and Diseases" vs. "Crime and Accidents").
