#### **1. Suitable Name for the Project**
**Fashion MNIST Classification with Dimensionality Reduction**

#### **2. Project Title**
**Evaluating the Impact of Dimensionality Reduction on Fashion MNIST Classification Performance**

#### **3. Project Description**
This project explores the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques in improving classification performance on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The study compares classification models using Kernel PCA, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Isomap against models trained on the original dataset. The classification models considered are Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize their performance.

#### **4. Overview Description with Key Steps**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Load the Fashion MNIST dataset, remove duplicates, and split it into training and testing sets.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Apply Kernel PCA, LLE, and Isomap to reduce feature dimensions.
- **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:** Train Random Forest and KNN classifiers using GridSearchCV for parameter optimization.
- **Evaluation:** Compare the classification accuracy across different dimensionality reduction techniques and the original dataset.
- **Key Insights:** Identify the best-performing approach based on classification accuracy.

#### **5. Goals**
- **Assess Dimensionality Reduction Impact:** Evaluate whether reducing feature dimensions enhances or degrades classification performance.
- **Optimize Classifier Performance:** Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best configurations for Random Forest and KNN.
- **Compare Classifier Accuracy:** Determine which combination of dimensionality reduction and classification model provides the highest accuracy.

#### **6. Results**
- **Best Model:** The highest accuracy was achieved using **Random Forest without dimensionality reduction (87.71%)**.
- **Kernel PCA Performance:** Among the dimensionality reduction methods, Kernel PCA performed best, particularly with Random Forest (75.53% accuracy).
- **Impact of Dimensionality Reduction:** Using dimensionality reduction **reduced accuracy** compared to using the original dataset, suggesting that important features were lost in transformation.

#### **7. Results Pointers**
1. **Best Accuracy:** Random Forest without dimensionality reduction achieved the highest accuracy (87.71%), outperforming all models with dimensionality reduction.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction Effects:** Kernel PCA provided better accuracy compared to LLE and Isomap, but none of the dimensionality reduction techniques improved classification performance over using the full dataset.
3. **Classifier Comparison:** Random Forest consistently outperformed KNN across all scenarios, showing its ability to capture complex patterns more effectively.

#### **8. Tech Stack & Algorithms Used**
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `sklearn` (Scikit-Learn)
- **Dimensionality Reduction Methods:** Kernel PCA, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap
- **Classification Algorithms:** Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy score
- **Optimization Techniques:** GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

### **Conclusion**
This project highlights that while dimensionality reduction techniques like Kernel PCA can retain useful information, they still lead to lower classification accuracy compared to using the full dataset. The best-performing approach was **Random Forest without dimensionality reduction**, demonstrating that preserving all feature dimensions is more beneficial for this dataset.
